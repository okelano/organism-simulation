Django Migrations Package

This directory contains Django migration files for the 'app' application.
Migrations are used to propagate changes made to the models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into the database schema.

This file is required for Python to recognize this directory as a package.
It can be left empty or include initialization code if needed.

For more information on Django migrations, refer to:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/migrations/
"""

# Imports or initialization code can be added here if needed
# Example: import any necessary modules or packages related to migrations

# Example: Add logging or custom initialization code if required
# import logging
# logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# logger.info("Migrations package initialized.")
